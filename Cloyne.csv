Last year, we had a culture of consent built into the community agreements regarding music, but even then I never felt like I could actually ask people to turn it off if I really needed to. The same is true now, and I end up either miserable and in pain or forced out of where I need to be.

In particular, the speaker in the kitchen is a big problem. I understand why people like it, and so do I sometimes, but if I'm not able to be somewhere with music, I pretty much can't eat. If I have a dish shift and am particularly sensitive to it at that time, I don't have the choice to stay out and end up in pain/miserable/suicidal due to it.

I've attended groups with similarly inclusive titles in the past and in general the experiences of the attendees are so different that the idea of having a support circle around their shared experiences kinda falls flat. The only one that seem to me to have enough in common between all attendees to justify its specific existence is the trans/nb/gnc circle. But in general groups that are trans/nb/gnc tend (that I've seen) to only address the gender identity/transitioning aspects of it (which centers trans/nb experiences but doesn't generally address gnc experiences), and not focus on the experiences of visible gender-nonconformity in society that are in fact the binding tie between trans/nb/gnc people in the first place, and also IME tend to assume that everyone attending is trans-identified, which can be alienating to gnc people who are not trans-identified. On the other hand, it would make a lot of sense to have these groups if your goal was political action: there's obviously a lot of solidarity between the identities included in these groups. But as a support group, I think there has to be more in common for it to be effective.","Focus groups or interviews (for HI hours), Improving and running this survey again","Gender/sexuality-oppressed people, General members (to improve general community)",,,
